Hi! I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**, rhymes with cushion). I am an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. 

My interests lie in understanding and building machines that are vastly beneficial to everyone. To that end, my fascinations include ML, Information Theory, and Linguistics. These days, I spend my time working on [preference learning](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences) and [learning theory]([https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6120](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/sEyWufriufTnBKnTG/incidental-polysemanticity)). 

In my spare time, I like to read natural history, moral philosophy and science fiction. I'm also into [photography](https://kushalthaman.tumblr.com/), going on outdoor adventures and playing squash and soccer. Here's a bigger [list]() of things I enjoy. I currently don't write much on this blog, but I'm looking to change that. 

Feel free to send me an email at {kushal} at {stanford} dot {edu} if you'd like to chat about anything you think we'd both enjoy!
