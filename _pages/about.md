Hi! I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**). I am an undergraduate student at Stanford University studying Mathematics and Computer Science. 

My main interests lie in understanding and building digitally intelligent machines that will be vastly beneficial to humanity. These days, I spend my time trying to do this with Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Feel free to send me an email at {kushal} at {stanford} dot {edu} if you'd like to chat!
