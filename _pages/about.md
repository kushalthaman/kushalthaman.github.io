Hi! I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**). I am an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. 

My main interests lie in understanding and building digitally intelligent machines that will be vastly beneficial to humanity. These days, I spend my time trying to do this by [making robots learn human preferences](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences) (often using Deep RL or IL) and Learning Theory.  

In my spare time, I like to read natural history, moral philosophy and science fiction literature. I'm also into [photography](https://kushalthaman.tumblr.com/), going on outdoor adventures and playing squash and soccer. Here's a bigger [list]() of things I enjoy. I currently don't write much on this blog, but I'm looking to change that. 

Feel free to send me an email at {kushal} at {stanford} dot {edu} if you'd like to chat about anything you think we'd both enjoy!
