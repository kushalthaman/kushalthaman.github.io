I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**, rhymes with cushion), an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science and Math. 

My interests lie in mechanistically understanding and building AIs that are vastly beneficial to everyone. These days, I spend my time working on deep generative models, and I enjoy reading about and working on compositional generalization, preference learning, [interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03096) and the science of learning and emergence.

In my spare time, I like to read science fiction, do [photography](https://kushalthaman.tumblr.com/), explore mountains and play squash and soccer. Here's a bigger [list]() of things I like. I currently don't write much on this blog, but I'm looking to change that. 

Reach out if you'd like to chat about anything you think we'd both enjoy!
