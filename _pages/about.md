I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**, rhymes with cushion), an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science and Math. 

My interests lie in understanding and building AIs that are vastly beneficial to everyone. These days, I spend my time working on generative models, and these days I'm especially interested in [preference learning](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences) and [learning theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03096). 

In my spare time, I like to read science fiction, do [photography](https://kushalthaman.tumblr.com/), go on outdoor adventures and play squash and soccer. Here's a bigger [list]() of things I enjoy. I currently don't write much on this blog, but I'm looking to change that. 

Reach out if you'd like to chat about anything you think we'd both enjoy!
