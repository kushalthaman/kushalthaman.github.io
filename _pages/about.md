Hi, I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**, rhymes with cushion). I am an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science and Math. 

My interests lie in understanding and building AIs that are vastly beneficial to everyone. These days, I spend my time working on [preference learning](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences) and [learning theory](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/sEyWufriufTnBKnTG/incidental-polysemanticity). 

In my spare time, I like to read moral philosophy and science fiction, do [photography](https://kushalthaman.tumblr.com/), go on outdoor adventures and play squash and soccer. Here's a bigger [list]() of things I enjoy. I currently don't write much on this blog, but I'm looking to change that. 

Feel free to send me an email at {kushal} at {stanford} dot {edu} if you'd like to chat about anything you think we'd both enjoy!
