Hi! I am an undergraduate student at Stanford University majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. Before starting my studies to Stanford, I lived in India where I participated in the physics and astronomy olympiads, was awarded the [Atlas Fellowship](http://atlasfellowship.org/) and became a [ML Safety Scholar](https://safe.ai/updates).
