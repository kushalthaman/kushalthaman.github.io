Hi! I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**). I am an undergraduate student at Stanford University studying Mathematics and Computer Science. 

My main interests lie in understanding and building digitally intelligent machines that will be vastly beneficial to humanity. These days, I spend my time trying to do this with Deep Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning and Learning Theory. I also enjoy math and Theoretical Computer Science puzzles. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading about evolutionary biology, history and moral philosophy as well as reading cyberpunk and science fiction, and I'm into hiking, photography, cinematography and playing Go, squash and soccer. 

Feel free to send me an email at {kushal} at {stanford} dot {edu} if you'd like to chat!
