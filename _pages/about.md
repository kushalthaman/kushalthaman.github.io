I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**, rhymes with cushion), an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science and Math. In the past, I worked on [science of neural network training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03096) at [STAIR](https://stair.cs.stanford.edu/), and now think about in-context learning at [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) with Prof. Chris Manning's group. 

In my spare time, I like to do [photography](https://kushalthaman.tumblr.com/), explore mountains, and play tennis and soccer. I currently don't write much on this blog, but I'm looking to change that. 

Reach out if you'd like to chat about anything you think we'd both enjoy!
