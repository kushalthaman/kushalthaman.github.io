I attended a <a href="[https://www.cambridgeaisafety.org/ml-winter-camp]">week-long ML winter camp</a> in Cambridge, UK. Here are some things I did when I was there.

***

The camp was based around completing the first two weeks of <a href="[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vvocfhQ7bcBR4FLBx/apply-to-the-second-ml-for-alignment-bootcamp-mlab-2-in]">this</a> curriculum. This is what the days looked like: 

#### Camp Days
<ul>
    <li>Day 1: rendering in Pytorch, building a ray tracer</li>
    <li>Day 2: building ResNets </li>
    <li>Day 3: build your own backpropagation framework</li>
    <li>Day 4: build your own BERT</li>
    <li>Day 5: build your own GPT-2, and finetune it!</li>
    <li>Day 6: transformer interpretability</li>
</ul>

This can be... a lot for 6 days. 

Takeaways: 
- Pair programming is very cool.
