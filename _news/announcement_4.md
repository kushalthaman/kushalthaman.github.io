I [presented](https://linguistics.stanford.edu/news/look-whos-talking-stanford-linguists-wccfl-42) our work on [Probabilistic Syllable Structure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_3eA-_trJMpZGyn0jWGloHFYbsG8fGC8/view?usp=sharing) at the [42nd West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics](https://www.wccfl42.com/) (WCCFL) at Berkeley, CA. Our full paper will be available in the conference proceedings soon.
